# Jira Clone Project

A simple and customizable Jira-inspired task management application. This project demonstrates a practical approach to building a task management tool, allowing users to create, track, and organize tasks visually.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Easily move tasks between columns (e.g., ToDo, In Progress, Done) using a user-friendly drag-and-drop feature.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Task cards change border colors based on their status:
  - Blue: `ToDo`
  - Yellow: `In Progress`
  - Green: `Done`
- **Priority Setting:** Assign priority levels to tasks for better organization.
- **Editable Tasks:** Update task details after creation.
